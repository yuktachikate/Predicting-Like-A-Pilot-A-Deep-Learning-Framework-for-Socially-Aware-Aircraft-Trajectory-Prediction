# Predicting-Like-A-Pilot-A-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Socially-Aware-Aircraft-Trajectory-Prediction
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for predicting aircraft trajectories in non-towered terminal airspace. The framework, inspired by the TrajAir paper, introduces a dataset simulation and a baseline model (ExtendedTrajAirNet)
